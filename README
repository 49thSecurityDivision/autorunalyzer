Autorunalyzer version: vaporware

This script is a work in progress and subject to frequent change. I'd create a
private repository for it, but I haven't upgraded my github plan yet. :(

The Autoruns output should be created with the -v (verify digital signatures)
and -f (create file hashes) options, as the script will depend on having them.

The development plan, such as it is, is to parse the output of Microsoft
Sysinternals Autoruns or Autorunsc in xml format. Give the user the option to
limit analysis to those entries that don't have verified digital signatures,
compare the hashes to a list of known good and known bad hashe, submit any 
unknown hashes to VirusTotal.com and report any that are reported as malicious
or that have not been seen by VirusTotal before.

The script will be written to rate limit submissions to VirusTotal at the
public API rate of four hashes per minute, but an API key can be supplied
in a configuration file for those with access to the private API. The rate
can then be adjusted by editing the configuration file.

My intention is for this to be a tool for use in incident detection/response.
Some environments may choose to run Autoruns as a scheduled task and to process
the results on a weekly basis. This may be useful for scaling up incident 
detection on the cheap.

Potential users should note that there are other mechanisms that attackers may
use for maintaining persistence. DLL hijacking would be one way and more
sophisticated attackers don't bother with persistence through software
installed on victim systems, rather they maintain access via the use of stollen
credentials for legitimate users.
